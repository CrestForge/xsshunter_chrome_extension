    "message": "'L10n' refers to 'Localization' - 'L' and 'n' are obvious, and 10 comes from the number of letters between those two. It is the process/whatever of displaying something in the language of choice. It uses 'I18n', 'Internationalization', which refers to the tools/framework supporting L10n. I.e., something is internationalized if it has I18n support and can be localized. Something is localized for you if it is in your language/dialect.",
